# Magic (GPT)8 Ball ðŸŽ±

## Overview

The Magic (GPT)8 Ball is a modern reinvention of the classic fortune-telling toy, powered by AI and IoT technology. It features voice recognition, motion sensing, and real-time AI responses through ChatGPT. When shaken, it records your question through a built-in microphone, processes it using OpenAI's APIs, and displays a mystical response on its integrated circular display.

## Features

- Voice-activated recording with automatic silence detection
- Motion-based activation using QMI8658 6-axis IMU
- Real-time transcription using OpenAI's Whisper API
- AI-powered responses from ChatGPT
- Smooth animations and UI transitions
- RGB LED status indicator
- Haptic feedback through dual vibration motors
- WiFi manager for easy network setup
- Offline mode with classic Magic 8 Ball responses
- Built-in battery management and charging

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pio lib install
   ```

3. Build and upload:

   ```bash
   pio run --target upload
   ```

## Usage Instructions

### First-Time Setup

1. Power on the device
2. Connect to "MagicGPT8Ball" WiFi network
3. Configure your WiFi through the captive portal
4. Device will restart and connect to your network

### Daily Use

1. Wake device by moving it or pressing the power button
2. Wait for "Shake me" prompt
3. Shake device to activate recording
4. Speak your question clearly
5. Wait for response (blue animation indicates processing)
6. Device will display the AI-generated response
7. Shake again for a new question

### LED Status Indicators

- Blue pulse: Starting up
- Solid green: Ready
- Red blink: Recording
- Cyan pulse: Processing
- Yellow blink: Offline mode
- Purple blink: Error state

## Advanced Features

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by uncommenting `#define ENABLE_DEBUG` in the following files:

- `Recorder.h` - Audio debugging
- `main.cpp` - System debugging

### Voice Detection Parameters

Adjust sensitivity in `Recorder.h`:

- `AUDIO_THRESHOLD`: Voice detection threshold
- `SILENCE_TIMEOUT`: Silence duration before stopping
- `MAX_RECORD_SECONDS`: Maximum recording duration

### Animation Settings

Customize animations in `Animations.h`:

- `MOTION_SMOOTHING`: Movement smoothness
- `GYRO_SENSITIVITY`: Motion sensitivity
- `IDLE_AMPLITUDE`: Idle animation range
